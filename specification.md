## Purpose 
For users having less sql knowledge have a better understanding of data

## Features
User need to manually set a desired amount of cardinality. Then user will have N sliders to define query. When user set the pth slider manually, it will change the constraint of the [p,n] sliders to match the cardinality they want.

## Tests
Manually set all attributes but one, then check the constraint of the unset attribute.  
Tests will be conducted on a pre-selected dataset of movies. 

## Implementation
This will be implemented by python. It may be a command line program, since GUI is not the main focus.
