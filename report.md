# This is the report for CPSC 448
### How to setup and use
Please check readme.md
### What I have done
 - Installing and setting up database and user for a postgresql database on MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu)
 - Importing a tsv file into postgresql database with a nonstandard delimiter by querying 
with proper data types and user permissions
 - Implementing a python tool utilizing psycopg2 library, with a CLI, 
reusable database class and query list for future upgrades 
 - Creating queries for obtaining database information including tables, columns and datatypes
for user to choose
 - Creating a function to find a range of one column that contains desired amount of tuples
### What I learnt:
 - Understanding the schema concept of Postgresql
 - Learning Python and psycopg2 library
 - Creating a CLI, handling user IO with python
 - Learning the concept of shirking and relaxing in queries for large amount of data.
 - Writing a project proposal, specification and manual page
 - Communicating and collaborating with others
### What I will improve if I have more time
  - Making better suggestions with the highest data density
    (It is starting from the minimum value of the column now)
  - Tests and comments
  - Refactor UI for better efficiency and readability
  - Probably a webui (with a backend) will be more intuitive
  - Making suggestions based on user-chosen attributes
  - Suggesting function rewrite for better performance
